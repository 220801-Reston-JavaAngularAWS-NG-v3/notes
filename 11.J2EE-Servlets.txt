web server
	- tomcat, weblogic, jboss - different avaliable web servers
web client

web application - we can host/deploy a web application into a web server
		- a collection of web pages
		
web pages
	 2 types
	---------
	- static web page
		- the contents of the page do not change at the server side

	- dynamic web page
		- the contents of the page change at the server side

contents of the page
-------------------
	- can be changed at server side
		- how do we do this? - Servlets , JSP(Java Server Pages)

	- can be changed at client side
		- how do we do this? - Javascript

what do i need to know to create a web page?
-------------------------------------------

	- HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language [ CSS(styling), Javascript ] - static web page
	- Servlets, JSP - dynamic web pages

Steps
------
1) Create a dynamic web project in eclipse
	3 things
		- specify the name of the project
		- choose the web module version depending on the version of tomcat installed
		- choose web.xml file to be included(optional)
2) Right cick on the project and create a new servlet
	- this servlet extends HttpServlet
3) you will see a lot of red crosses
	- to fix this copy the servlet-api.jar file ( avaliable in the lib folder of tomcat) into the lib folder(which is inside WEB-INF folder) of your project in eclipse

4) Finish the code inside the servlet

5) deploy the web application in tomcat server

6) start the tomcat server

7) open a browser and place a request for the servlet that we just created
	
Step 5, 6, 7 can be done by the steps mentioned below

	- configure a server(tomcat) in eclipse (one time work)
	- right click on the servlet and Run as --> on server ( do it every time when you want to run the servlet)
