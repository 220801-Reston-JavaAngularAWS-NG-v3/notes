JDBC - Java Database Connectivity
----------------------------------


Types of JDBC Drivers - interview question
---------------------

1) Type 1 - JDBC ODBC bridge
		- slowest of all 
		- 
2) Type 2

3) Type 3

4) Type 4 - native driver
		- fastest of all
		- most preferred


the driver 
	- is a java class
	- would be present in a jar file


Maven - a build tool
	- helps in managing the jars files/ dependencies required for the project
	- the main purpose of maven is it is a build tool - to build your project

Gradle - also a build tool

types of execution methods
--------------------------

// step 3 - create a statement and execute it
Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();

boolean status = stmt.execute(query); // used to execute DDL queries ( create, alter, drop)
int rowsAffected = stmt.executeUpdate(query); // used to execute DML queries (insert, update, delete)
ResultSet rs = stsmt.executeQuery(query); // used to execute DQL queries (select)

types of statements
-------------------
1) Statement
	- here the query will always be compiled and executed at the DB server side 
2) PreparedStatement
	- pre-compiled statements
	- the query is compiled once and executed many times at the DB server side
	- we can see an increase in performance of the execution of the queries when we execute the same query again and again
3) CallableStatement
	- is used to call a stored procedure
