Java 8 was released on 18th March 2014. 
That’s a long time ago but still many projects are running on Java 8. 
It’s because it was a major release with a lot of new features. 

Some of the important Java 8 features are
-----------------------------------------
Functional Interfaces and Lambda Expressions
forEach() method in Iterable interface
default and static methods in Interfaces
Java Stream API for Bulk Data Operations on Collections
Java Time API
Collection API improvements
Concurrency API improvements
Java IO improvements

default and static methods in Interfaces
----------------------------------------
	- prior to Java 1.8 , interfaces can have only abstract methods
	- from 1.8 version java interfaces had default(methods with body definition) methods and static(static methods with body definition) methods, along with the abstract methods.

Functional Interfaces and Lambda Expressions
---------------------------------------------
Functional Interface
	- it has exactly one abstract method ( can have any number of default and static methods)
	- we used to call interfaces with one abstract method as SAM(Single Abstract Method) interfaces
	- Eg: java.lang.Comparable , java.lang.Runnable and many more
	- we can use the annotation @FuntionalInterface above a functional interface to make sure that it is a functional interface

if we have a functional interface, how do i implement the functional interface?

3 ways
------
	- conventional way
	- anonymous classes
	- lambda expressions
