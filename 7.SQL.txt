ways to store data permanently 
1) Files
2) DBMS

CRUD
----
C - Create
R - Read
U- Update
D - Delete

DB - Database
DBMS - Database Management System/Software
     - a software 

Database software product and its vendors
------------------------------------------
1) Oracle provided by Oracle Corporation
2) SqlServer provided by Microsoft
3) MySql
4) Postgres

SQL - Structured Querying Language, ANSII SQL

some diferrences/variations is called the dialect - Oracle dialect, postgres dialect, 


Client/Server Architecture
-------------------------
	- multi user DB which uses client/server communication
	- a web server host a web application which can provide a webpage upon a request from a client
	- a file server hosts files which can provide files upon a request from a client
	- a database server hosts database which provide data upon a request from the client

	- in order for any client to contact the server, info that the client should know
		1) Protocol
		2) IP address of the computer in which the server is running
		3) Port number - a 4 digit, many servers listen on their default port numbers, like tomcat(web server) - 8080, weblogic(web server) - 7001, 
												postgres(database server) - 5432
		4) credentials - username/ password

after installing postgres you have the 
		- postgres server
		- postgres clients - psql (CLI), we can find psql here - C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\14\bin
				   - pgadmin4 (GUI), we can find pgadmin here - C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\14\pgAdmin 4\bin
				   - dbeaver (GUI) , has to be installed seperately
				   - java program

steps
------
	-pre requisite for client to contact the server - the server should be up and running
	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		I went to the services, and made sure postgres 14 server service is running

	-to connect to postgres server from command prompt (cmd)
	---------------------------------------------------
		C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\14\bin>psql --host=localhost --port=5432 --username=postgres --password
			- here --host, --port, --password in not required as long as you choose to work with the default settings
			- once you enter the password, psql will connect to the server and we should see postgres=# prompt


database 
	- a collection of tables
	- the postgres installation has a default database created called postgres
	- you can list all the databases available in the server
		use \l to list all the databases
	- the prompt tell us the database that we are connected to.
	- you can create your own databases
		create database <db name>;
	- you can connect/switch to a db 
		\c <db name>
		now the prompt would change to the db name
table
	- has rows and columns
	- each row in a table is called a record
	- store the data
	- command to list all the tables in the current/connected DB
		\dt 

the commands that start with backslash are called meta commands - specifc to postgres

the SQL queries are categorized into 5
--------------------------------------
	1) DDL - Data Definition Language
			- work with the structure of the table
			- create a table, alter a table, drop a table

	2) DML - Data Manipulation Language
			- work on the data present in a table
			- insert a record, update a record, delete a record
			
	3) DQL - Data Querying Language
			- fetch the record from the table
			- select query
			- though there is only 1 query it has multiple clauses

	4) TCL - Transaction Querying Language
			- work with transactions
			- commit, rollback, savepoints

	5) DCL - Data Control Language
			- granting/revoke priveleges to/from users
			- a previlege could be creating a table, insert record into the table etc

Queries that I used in session
------------------------
1)
CREATE DATABASE book_management_system;

2)
\c book_management_system;

3) 
\l;

4)
\dt;

5)
CREATE TABLE book_details(book_id  INT, book_title VARCHAR(100), book_author VARCHAR(50), book_genre VARCHAR(20), book_cost INT, book_image_url VARCHAR(255));

6) 
ALTER TABLE book_details DROP COLUMN book_image_url;

7) 
ALTER TABLE book_details ADD COLUMN book_image_url VARCHAR(255);

8) 
ALTER TABLE book_details ALTER COLUMN book_image_url TYPE VARCHAR(250);

9)
DROP TABLE book_details;
I created the table again

10)
INSERT INTO book_details VALUES(101, 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets', 'J.K.Rowling', 'Fiction', 45, '');
INSERT INTO book_details VALUES(102, 'Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince', 'J.K.Rowling', 'Fiction', 40, '');
SELECT * FROM book_details;

11)
UPDATE book_details SET book_cost=42 WHERE book_id=102;
UPDATE book_details SET book_cost=42;    -----------> be careful with this query
SELECT * FROM book_details;

12)
DELETE FROM book_details WHERE book_id=102;
SELECT * FROM book_details;

13)
DROP TABLE book_details;
CREATE TABLE book_details(book_id  INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY, book_title VARCHAR(100), book_author VARCHAR(50), book_genre VARCHAR(20), book_cost INT, book_image_url VARCHAR(255));
INSERT INTO book_details(book_title, book_author, book_genre, book_cost, book_image_url) VALUES('Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets', 'J.K.Rowling', 'Fiction', 45, '');
INSERT INTO book_details(book_title, book_author, book_genre, book_cost, book_image_url) VALUES('Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix', 'J.K.Rowling', 'Fiction', 40, '');
INSERT INTO book_details(book_title, book_author, book_genre, book_cost, book_image_url) VALUES('Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince', 'J.K.Rowling', 'Fiction', 30, '');
SELECT * FROM book_details;
