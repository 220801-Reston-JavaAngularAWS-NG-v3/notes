ways to store data permanently 
1) Files
2) DBMS

CRUD
----
C - Create
R - Read
U- Update
D - Delete

DB - Database
DBMS - Database Management System/Software
     - a software 
RDBMS - Relational Database Management System
      - here data is stored in tables which in turn consists of rows and columns
      - Eg. Postgres, Oracle, SQL Server, MySql
NoSql - eg. Mongo db

Database software product and its vendors
------------------------------------------
1) Oracle provided by Oracle Corporation
2) SqlServer provided by Microsoft
3) MySql
4) Postgres

SQL - Structured Querying Language, ANSII SQL

some diferrences/variations is called the dialect - Oracle dialect, postgres dialect, 


Client/Server Architecture
-------------------------
	- multi user DB which uses client/server communication
	- a web server hosts a web application which can provide a webpage upon a request from a client
	- a file server hosts files which can provide files upon a request from a client
	- a database server hosts database which provide data upon a request from the client

	- in order for any client to contact the server, info that the client should know
		1) Protocol
		2) IP address of the computer in which the server is running
		3) Port number - a 4 digit, many servers listen on their default port numbers, like tomcat(web server) - 8080, weblogic(web server) - 7001, 
												postgres(database server) - 5432
		4) credentials - username/ password

after installing postgres you have the 
		- postgres server
		- postgres clients - psql (CLI), we can find psql here - C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\14\bin
				   - pgadmin4 (GUI), we can find pgadmin here - C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\14\pgAdmin 4\bin
				   - dbeaver (GUI) , has to be installed seperately
				   - java program

steps
------
	-pre requisite for client to contact the server - the server should be up and running
	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		I went to the services, and made sure postgres 14 server service is running

	-to connect to postgres server from command prompt (cmd)
	---------------------------------------------------
		C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\14\bin>psql --host=localhost --port=5432 --username=postgres --password
			- here --host, --port, --password in not required as long as you choose to work with the default settings
			- once you enter the password, psql will connect to the server and we should see postgres=# prompt


database 
	- a collection of tables
	- the postgres installation has a default database created called postgres
	- you can list all the databases available in the server
		use \l to list all the databases
	- the prompt tell us the database that we are connected to.
	- you can create your own databases
		create database <db name>;
	- you can connect/switch to a db 
		\c <db name>
		now the prompt would change to the db name
table
	- has rows and columns
	- each row in a table is called a record
	- store the data
	- command to list all the tables in the current/connected DB
		\dt 

the commands that start with backslash are called meta commands - specifc to postgres

the SQL queries are categorized into 5
--------------------------------------
	1) DDL - Data Definition Language
			- work with the structure of the table
			- create a table, alter a table, drop a table

	2) DML - Data Manipulation Language
			- work on the data present in a table
			- insert a record, update a record, delete a record
			
	3) DQL - Data Querying Language
			- fetch the record from the table
			- select query
			- though there is only 1 query it has multiple clauses

	4) TCL - Transaction Querying Language
			- work with transactions
			- commit, rollback, savepoints

	5) DCL - Data Control Language
			- granting/revoke priveleges to/from users
			- a previlege could be creating a table, insert record into the table etc

------------------------
1)
CREATE DATABASE book_management_system;

2)
\c book_management_system;

3) 
\l;

4)
\dt;

5)
CREATE TABLE book_details(book_id  INT, book_title VARCHAR(100), book_author VARCHAR(50), book_genre VARCHAR(20), book_cost INT, book_image_url VARCHAR(255));

6) 
ALTER TABLE book_details DROP COLUMN book_image_url;

7) 
ALTER TABLE book_details ADD COLUMN book_image_url VARCHAR(255);

8) 
ALTER TABLE book_details ALTER COLUMN book_image_url TYPE VARCHAR(250);

9)
DROP TABLE book_details;
I created the table again

10)
INSERT INTO book_details VALUES(101, 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets', 'J.K.Rowling', 'Fiction', 45, '');
INSERT INTO book_details VALUES(102, 'Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince', 'J.K.Rowling', 'Fiction', 40, '');
SELECT * FROM book_details;

11)
UPDATE book_details SET book_cost=42 WHERE book_id=102;
UPDATE book_details SET book_cost=42;    -----------> be careful with this query
SELECT * FROM book_details;

12)
DELETE FROM book_details WHERE book_id=102;
SELECT * FROM book_details;

13)
DROP TABLE book_details;
CREATE TABLE book_details(book_id  INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY, book_title VARCHAR(100), book_author VARCHAR(50), book_genre VARCHAR(20), book_cost INT, book_image_url VARCHAR(255));
INSERT INTO book_details(book_title, book_author, book_genre, book_cost, book_image_url) VALUES('Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets', 'J.K.Rowling', 'Fiction', 45, '');
INSERT INTO book_details(book_title, book_author, book_genre, book_cost, book_image_url) VALUES('Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix', 'J.K.Rowling', 'Fiction', 40, '');
INSERT INTO book_details(book_title, book_author, book_genre, book_cost, book_image_url) VALUES('Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince', 'J.K.Rowling', 'Fiction', 30, '');
SELECT * FROM book_details;



Constraints
----------
- controls the data that you add to the table
- can be added in 3 ways
	1) column level constraint ( at the time of creating the table)

CREATE TABLE person (
	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	first_name VARCHAR (50),
	last_name VARCHAR (50),
	email VARCHAR (50) UNIQUE
);

	2) table level constraint ( at the time of creating the table)

CREATE TABLE person (
	id SERIAL  PRIMARY KEY,
	first_name VARCHAR (50),
	last_name  VARCHAR (50),
	email      VARCHAR (50),
        UNIQUE(email)
);
	3) Alter the table to add the contraint ( after the table has been created)

ALTER TABLE production_orders 
ALTER COLUMN qty
SET NOT NULL;

ALTER TABLE book_details ALTER COLUMN book_title SET NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE book_details ALTER COLUMN book_author SET NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE book_details ALTER COLUMN book_genre SET NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE book_details ALTER COLUMN book_cost SET NOT NULL;


Primary Key
	- every table should have a primary key column/constraint
	- a column declared with primary key contraint by default is UNIQUE and NOT NULL
	- the primary key column is automatically indexed

UPDATE employee_details SET emp_city='Atlanta' WHERE emp_id=6784;


 	CREATE TABLE book_details(book_id  INT PRIMARY KEY GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY, 
				  book_title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, 
				  book_author VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, 
				  book_genre VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, 
				  book_cost INT NOT NULL, 
				  book_image_url VARCHAR(255));


Foreign keys
------------

CREATE TABLE department_details (dept_id INT PRIMARY KEY GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY, dept_name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL);

// CREATE TABLE employee_details(emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY, emp_name VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL, emp_contact INT NOT NULL, emp_dept_id INT);

CREATE TABLE employee_details(emp_id INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY, 
			      emp_name VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL, 
                              emp_contact INT NOT NULL, 
                              emp_dept_id INT, 
                              PRIMARY KEY(emp_id),
			      FOREIGN KEY(emp_dept_id) REFERENCES department_details(dept_id)
                             );

Select query in detail
-----------------------
SELECT <projection column list>
	FROM <table name>
	WHERE <condn>
	GROUP BY <column name list>
	HAVING <condn>
	ORDER BY <column name list> ASC|DESC


SELECT * FROM employee_details;
SELECT emp_id, emp_name FROM employee_details;

display emp_id and emp_name of those employees whose dept_id is 2
SELECT emp_id, emp_name FROM employee_details WHERE emp_dept_id=2;

display all the details of the employees whose dept_id is 2 in descending order of the employee name
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, emp_contact, emp_dept_id FROM employee_details WHERE emp_dept_id=2 ORDER BY emp_name DESC;

display all the details of the employees whose dept_id is 2 in ascending order of the employee name
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, emp_contact, emp_dept_id FROM employee_details WHERE emp_dept_id=2 ORDER BY emp_name;


Scalar functions and aggregate functions
----------------------------------------
reference 
	- https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/functions.html

	- a scalar function works on the individial values of the column
		SELECT upper(book_title) FROM book_details;
	- an aggregate function works on all the values of the column and produces one output
		SELECT count(book_title) FROM book_details;
		SELECT max(book_cost) FROM book_details;
		SELECT max(book_cost) expensive FROM book_details;


groupby and having clause of select query
------------------------------------------
	- can apply aggregation by grouping one or many columns
	- having clause is aplly a condn on the grouping
	- the where clause applies the restriction/ filter the record before the grouping takes place whereas the having clause applies the restriction/filter after the grouping takes place
	- try grouping on mutliple columns
SELECT count(book_genre) FROM book_details;
SELECT count(book_genre) FROM book_details GROUP BY (book_genre);

fetch the count of books in each genre
--------------------------------------
SELECT book_genre, count(book_genre) FROM book_details GROUP BY (book_genre);

fetch the book author and the number of books authored by the authors
---------------------------------------------------------------------
SELECT book_author, count(book_author) FROM book_details GROUP BY (book_author);

fetch the book author and the number of books authored by the authors whose count is lesser than 5
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SELECT book_author, count(book_author) FROM book_details GROUP BY (book_author) HAVING count(book_author)<=5;

fetch the book author and the number of books which costs greater than 30 dollars , authored by the authors whose count is lesser than 5
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 SELECT book_author, count(book_author) FROM book_details WHERE book_cost>30 GROUP BY (book_author) HAVING count(book_author)<=5;

fetch the details of authors who have authored less than 5 books
-------------------------------------------------------------------
SELECT book_author, count(book_author) FROM book_details GROUP BY (book_author) HAVING count(book_author)<=5;

find the most expensive book authored by each author
----------------------------------------------------
SELECT book_author, max(book_cost) FROM book_details GROUP BY book_author;

find the most expensive book in the library
-------------------------------------------
SELECT max(book_cost) FROM book_details;



subqueries
-----------
	-write to query to display the details of books whose cost is greater than 35 dollars
		SELECT * FROM book_details WHERE book_cost>35;
	-write to query to display the details of books whose cost is greater than the average book cost
		SELECT * FROM book_details WHERE book_cost>(SELECT avg(book_cost) FROM book_details);
	-if your select query has to work on an unknown/ computed value we can write a subquery to compute the unknown value and then the outter / main query works on computed value
	- we can further nest the sub query with another sub query
	- we also have correlated subquery

joins
------
- if we have to fetch data from 2 or more tables we use joins

department_details
	dept_id(PK)
	dept_name

employee_details
	emp_id(PK)
	emp_name
	emp_contact
	emp_dept_id(FK)

- write a query to display employee id,employee name and department name of each employee
	SELECT emp_id, emp_name, dept_name FROM employee_details, department_details;
		this does not give the desired out as each record of the left table is combined with each record table
	SELECT emp_id, emp_name, dept_name FROM employee_details, department_details WHERE employee_details.emp_dept_id=department_details.dept_id;
		this would be the correct soln becuase the join takes place on the join condition
		this style of writing a join is called theta style
		this is old way of writing a join
	SELECT emp_id, emp_name, dept_name FROM employee_details INNER JOIN department_details ON employee_details.emp_dept_id=department_details.dept_id;
		this is the newer way of writing join - join style
		we use the JOIN keyword and the ON keyword

cartesian products
--------------------
A(3, 6, 1)
B(7, 4)
A X B = (3, 7) (3, 4) (6, 7) (6, 4) (1, 7) (1, 4)


type of joins
-------------
- INNER JOIN
- LEFT JOIN
- RIGHT JOIN
- SELF JOIN
- CROSS JOIN
- FULL OUTTER JOIN
- NATURAL JOIN



Set operations in sql
---------------------
1) UNION
The UNION operator combines result sets of two or more SELECT statements into a single result set.

2) UNION ALL


3) INTERSECT

conditions
----------
To combine the result sets of two queries using the UNION operator, the queries must conform to the following rules:

The number and the order of the columns in the select list of both queries must be the same.
The data types must be compatible.


A(2,5,3)
B(1,5)

A Union B (A U B) = (1,2,3,5)
A Union all B = (1,2,3,5,5)
A Intersect B = (5)

Views
------
	- https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/sql-createview.html

	SELECT emp_id, emp_name, dept_name FROM employee_details INNER JOIN department_details ON employee_details.emp_dept_id=department_details.dept_id;

	CREATE VIEW employee_department_view AS SELECT emp_id, emp_name, dept_name FROM employee_details INNER JOIN department_details ON employee_details.emp_dept_id=department_details.dept_id;

	SELECT * FROM employee_department_view;

	further to explore
	-----------------
	- can I add a where clause when I select froma  view?
	- can I execute a delete/insert/update query on the view?
	- can I use a view in a subquery?
	- can I use a view in a join query?

student_details
-------------
	stud_id
	stud_name
	course_name

stud_id determines stud_name, in other words stud_name is functionaly dependent on stud_id
does stud_id determine course_name? No. in other words course_name is not functionally dependent on stud_id
so now student_Details is not in 2NF

	- remove the non-functionally dependent column and keep in a sepreate table and introduce foreign keys

Transactions
-------------

money transfer - transaction

executing 2 update queries

UPDATE account_details SET acc_balance=acc_balance-500 WHERE acc_number=101;  // debiting USD 500 from 101

	// lets say the DB server crashed
UPDATE account_details SET acc_balance=acc_balance+500 WHERE acc_number=105; // crediting USD 500 to 105

rule of a transactoin
	- all the queries in the transaction execute otherwise none should execute		
	- if all the queries in the transaction, the transaction was successfull
	- if none of the queries i would say the transction failed
	- but in either case i have consistent/correct data in the table
	

3 keywords in transaction
-------------------------
begin transaction
	when we begin the transaction the auto commit is set to false
comit
	when we say commit the queries that were executed after the transaction has begun, will the chages permanent in the tables
	it marks the end of the transaction
	if a commit has reached, means the transaction was successfull
	the database reached a new state of consistency
rollback
	when we say rollback all the queries that were executed after the transaction has begun will revert
	it marks the end of the transaction
	if a rollback reached, means it is a failed transaction
	the database remains in the old state of consistency
savepoints
	can create multiple savepoints within a trasaction
