archive types
--------------
.jar - java archive
.war - web archive
.ear - enterprise archive ( .jar + .war)

editions of java
-----------------
J2SE - Java 2 Standard Edition -  this is our focus
J2EE - Java 2 Enterprise Edition
J2ME - Java 2 Micro Edition

Java software
--------------

JDK - Java Development Kit
JRE - Java Runtime Enviroment
JVM - Java Virtual Machine


Demo.java ---> compile(javac) ---> Demo.class ---> executed(java) ----> output ( for this we need JDK)
(source code)			   (Byte code)

Demo.class ---> executed(java) ----> output ( for this we just need the JRE)

JDK = JRE + java compiler

JRE = JVM + Class Loader + Byte code verifier + Garbage collector + Default handler + more

Types of programs
-----------------
1. System programs
	- created for the system to work
	- OS, Loader, etc
	- C language, concept of pointers
2. Application programs
	- created for end users
	- MS Word, ecxel, ppt, bank management system
	- Java is used to create application programs

Types of programming Paradigm
-----------------------------
1. Procedural programming
	- not convienient to create application programs
	- eg. C/c++
2. Object oriented programming
	- eg. java, c++


Features of java - please refer internet to see the list of features of java (interview question)
----------------
1) Object oriented programming language
	- classes and objects
2) Platform independent ( interview question)

	
C compilation and execution
---------------------------
First.c ----> compile ----> First.exe ------> execute -------> output

First.exe hold low level information about the platform in which it was created
First.exe is platform dependent

Java compilation and execution
-------------------------------
Demo.java ---> compile(javac) ---> Demo.class ---> executed(java) ----> output ( for this we need JDK)
(source code)			   (Byte code)

Demo.class does not hold any low level information thereby not making it platform dependent
Demo.class is platform independent
JVM becomes platfrom ddependent

low level info - the addressing - 32 bit or 64 bit


Java - takes the syntax from c
     - takes oops(modified version) concept from c++


things that you do in a program
-------------------------------
input
computation/ processing/bussiness logic
output


variables - stores a value
	  -  can change the value of a variable
