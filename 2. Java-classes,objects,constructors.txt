datatypes
	1. primitative datatypes -
	2. derived datatypes / non-primitive datatypes
	

object oriented programming
class  - design/template/blueprint/sketch/ framework/skeleton

object - an instance of a class
       - has certain behaviour

all keywords in java - small letters	

Naming convention ( strictly strictly followed)
	class - title cased, Eg. FordFigo, BankAccount, etc
	variables/methods - camel cased, Eg. numberPlate, startEngine()


a class contains
	- variables / attributes / properties / data members / state
	- methods / functions / member functions / behaviour
	- nested class
	- static block


two types of variable 
----------------------
1) instance variable/ variable
	these are variables declared in side a class and outside the method
	memory is always allocated in heap
	if not initialized will hold default value
		byte, short, int, long = 0
		float, double = 0.0
		char = '\o'
		boolean = false
		object ref variable = null
	the memory is realease only when the garbage collector runs

2) local variable
	these are declared inside a method
	memory is always allocated in stack
	if not initialized will hold garbage value
	memory is automatically deallocated when the method in which it is declared is over



input - in main method
process - in the bussiness methods
output - in main method

constructor
-----------
	- a method, but a special method
	- has the same name as that of the class
	- they are called automatically when an object is created 
	- does not have a return type, not even void
	- the purpose is to initialize instance variables  of the class
	- can be overloaded
	- when no constructor is provided a default constructor is injected into your class
	- the moment yopu provide a constructor, the default constructor is no longer injected
	
constructor chaining
--------------------
hint : this()
